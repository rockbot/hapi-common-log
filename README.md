# hapi-common-log

Parses the hapi request object to create a common log format log line

## Usage

```js

server.register([
  {
    register: require('hapi-common-log'),
  }
]);

// output: 127.0.0.1 - 1419961634390-24985-29768 [30/Dec/2014:09:47:14 -0800] "GET /static/images/npm-logo.svg HTTP/1.1" 200 -

```

## Options

Sometimes you want a specific header for incoming client IP (i.e. if you've got a proxy). To customize:

```js

server2.register([
  {
    register: require('hapi-common-log'),
    options: {
      ipHeader: 'x-forwarded-to'
    }
  }
]);

```

## The Common Log Format

From the [Wikipedia page on Common Log Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format):

```
127.0.0.1 user-identifier frank [10/Oct/2000: 13:55:36 -0700] "GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 2326
```

_A "-" in a field indicates missing data.[citation needed]_
